## Technical Specifications

### Metadata Field Format

Metadata fields follow a canonical format for tool interoperability:

```markdown
**FieldName:** value
```

**Canonical rules:**
- Field names in Title Case (e.g., `Project`, `Type`, `Created`)
- Bold formatting: `**FieldName:**` (two asterisks each side)
- Colon immediately after field name, followed by single space
- One field per line

**Lenient parsing (recommended):**

Tools SHOULD accept common variations to prioritise human-readability:

| Format | Status |
|---|---|
| `**Project:** Echo Valley` | Canonical |
| `Project: Echo Valley` | Accept (plain text) |
| `**Project :** Echo Valley` | Accept (extra space before colon) |
| `**project:** Echo Valley` | Accept (case-insensitive matching) |
| YAML frontmatter | Accept (alternative format) |

Tools that write BRIEF.md files SHOULD output the canonical format. Tools that read BRIEF.md files SHOULD be lenient.

### Naming Conventions

**Project Type values:**
- Always lowercase
- Underscores for multi-word types: `song`, `album`, `product_line`

**Extension names:**
- In markdown headings: ALL CAPS with spaces: `# SONIC ARTS`
- In metadata field: lowercase with underscores, comma-separated: `**Extensions:** sonic_arts, narrative_creative`

### Character Encoding

All text content supports the full UTF-8 character set including emoji, non-Latin scripts, and special characters. Tools MUST handle these correctly in both parsing and display.

### Alternative Metadata Formats

Tools MAY support additional metadata representations (YAML frontmatter, JSON, etc.) but MUST support the standard markdown field format. Example YAML equivalent:

```yaml
---
project: Echo Valley
type: song
created: 2026-01-15
extensions: [sonic_arts, narrative_creative]
status: development
---
```

---

## Context Discovery

### The Hierarchy Walk

When a tool opens a BRIEF.md file, it should discover parent context by walking up the directory tree:

```
function discover_context(brief_path):
    context_stack = []
    current_path = brief_path

    while current_path exists:
        if BRIEF.md exists at current_path:
            context_stack.append(parse_brief(current_path))
        current_path = parent_directory(current_path)

    return context_stack  # [item, collection, entity, ...]
```

**Depth limit:** Tools SHOULD implement a practical depth limit (recommended: 10 levels) and MUST handle filesystem loops gracefully (symlinks, mount points).

**Stop conditions:** Tools SHOULD stop walking when they reach a filesystem root, a version control root (`.git` directory), or the configured depth limit.

### Example: Music Hierarchy

```
the-wanderers/
├── BRIEF.md                    # Artist aesthetic: "sparse, intimate"
└── albums/
    └── midnight-train/
        ├── BRIEF.md            # Album theme: "nighttime restlessness"
        └── songs/
            └── echo-valley/
                └── BRIEF.md    # Song intent: "unresolved tension, 85 BPM"
```

Tool opens `echo-valley/BRIEF.md` and accumulates:

1. **Song:** small-town restlessness, 85 BPM
2. **Album:** nighttime theme, slow tempo
3. **Artist:** sparse, intimate production

### Example: Software Hierarchy

```
acme-corp/
├── BRIEF.md                    # Company: "developer-first, open-source ethos"
└── products/
    └── dataflow/
        ├── BRIEF.md            # Product: "real-time data pipeline framework"
        └── features/
            └── retry-engine/
                └── BRIEF.md    # Feature: "configurable retry with backoff"
```

### No Inheritance: Advisory Context

Context from parent BRIEF.md files is **advisory, not prescriptive**:

- Parents describe patterns they observe
- Children make their own decisions
- Tools warn about conflicts but don't enforce
- Users make final choices

Conflict detection between parent and child BRIEF.md files is implementation-specific. Future versions of this spec may provide guidance on conflict semantics.

### Walking Down: Collection Discovery

The up-walk is the core mechanism: discover the bigger context around the file you've opened. But tools can also **walk down** the hierarchy: scanning child directories for BRIEF.md files to show what a collection contains.

Use cases for walking down:
- An artist-level view that shows themes across all albums and songs
- A product-level view that surfaces which features have open questions
- Pattern detection: which projects share constraints, references, or extensions

Implementation notes:
- Walking down is an intentional user action (e.g., "show me what's in this collection"), not something that triggers on every file open
- Down-walks can be expensive in large hierarchies: consider lazy loading or depth limits
- Tools SHOULD handle directories without BRIEF.md files gracefully (skip, don't error)

---

## Context Application

Tools use discovered context in many ways. Here are illustrative patterns:

### Parent-Aware Operations

- **Alignment checking:** Does this item conflict with parent constraints?
- **Default suggestion:** What values are typical based on parent context?
- **Decision validation:** Does this choice contradict parent decisions?
- **Contextual intelligence:** What does parent context tell us about this item?

### Standalone Operations

- **Autocomplete:** Suggest field values from domain ontologies
- **Search and discovery:** Find projects by type, extension, or content
- **Visualisation:** Map relationships between projects
- **Export:** Convert to other formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- **Analytics:** Track decision patterns across projects
- **History:** Show evolution of decisions over time
- **Validation:** Check against extension requirements

### Example: DAW Integration

When a DAW opens a project with BRIEF.md:

1. Read the song's BRIEF.md: emotional intent, tempo, constraints
2. Walk up to album BRIEF.md: thematic context, genre
3. Walk up to artist BRIEF.md: production aesthetic

The DAW can then:
- Suggest presets aligned with the aesthetic
- Warn when changes contradict constraints
- Frame AI suggestions in emotional terms, not just technical ones

### Example: IDE Integration

When an IDE opens a feature directory with BRIEF.md:

1. Read the feature's BRIEF.md: what it does, constraints, decisions
2. Walk up to product BRIEF.md: architectural principles, tech stack
3. Walk up to company BRIEF.md: engineering philosophy

The IDE can then:
- Show relevant decisions when editing related code
- Warn when a change conflicts with documented constraints
- Provide decision context to AI coding assistants

## Interoperability Guidelines

### Handling Unknown Content

**Unknown metadata fields:**
- Tools MUST ignore gracefully
- Tools SHOULD preserve when editing
- Tools MAY log warnings

**Unknown extensions:**
- Tools MUST ignore sections they don't understand
- Tools MUST preserve content when editing files
- Tools MAY warn users about unrecognised extensions

**Unknown project types:**
- Tools SHOULD treat as generic project
- Tools MAY provide reduced functionality
- Tools MUST NOT reject the file

### Handling Malformed Content

**Invalid required fields:**
- Tools SHOULD provide clear error messages
- Example: Missing `**Project:**` field

**Partial files:**
- Tools MAY accept files missing optional sections
- Tools SHOULD warn about missing recommended sections

### Version Compatibility

**Forward compatibility (reading newer versions):**
- Tools reading v1.0 SHOULD accept v1.x files
- Tools SHOULD ignore new fields added in minor versions
- Tools SHOULD warn on major version mismatches (v2.0)

**Backward compatibility (reading older versions):**
- Tools implementing v1.1+ SHOULD support v1.0 files
- Tools MUST NOT require fields added in minor versions

**Version indicators:**
- Files MAY include `**Version:** 1.0` in metadata
- If absent, assume latest v1.x

### Preserving User Content

When editing BRIEF.md files, tools MUST:
- Preserve all sections they don't understand
- Maintain original formatting where possible
- Not delete unknown fields or content
- Add clear markers when adding tool-specific content

### Tool-Specific Sections

Tools may add custom content using a dedicated section at the end of the file:

```markdown
# TOOL SPECIFIC: SongMuse

Last session: 2026-01-20
Tool version: 2.1.3
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use all caps `TOOL SPECIFIC` prefix
- Include tool name
- Keep at end of file
- Other tools MUST preserve this section

### Comments

Standard HTML comments are supported:

```markdown
<!-- This is a comment that tools should preserve but not display -->
```

Tools SHOULD preserve comments when editing and not render them in UI.

## Extensions: Detailed Architecture

### What Extensions Are

An extension (called "Domain Families" in some earlier documentation) is:
- A named collection of related concepts
- Defined by communities
- Reusable across different project types
- Documented in a separate extension specification

### Structure of an Extension

Each extension is a markdown section with:

```markdown
# [EXTENSION NAME]

## [Subsection 1]
[Fields and content defined by extension spec]

## [Subsection 2]
[Fields and content defined by extension spec]

## References: [Type]
[References relevant to this extension]
```

### External Ontologies and Taxonomies

Extension specifications may recommend external ontologies for standardised vocabularies:

- **SONIC ARTS** might recommend MusicBrainz for genre classification
- **NARRATIVE CREATIVE** might recommend Theme Ontology for literary themes
- **SYSTEM DESIGN** might recommend standard architecture pattern catalogues

These are recommendations, not requirements. Users can use free text if ontologies don't fit their needs. When multiple projects follow the same ontologies, tools can provide smarter autocomplete, validation, semantic search, and cross-project analysis.

### Defining New Extensions

Anyone can propose a new extension. For now, proposals are welcome as GitHub issues. Each extension spec should document:

- Name and purpose
- Required and optional subsections
- Field names and their semantics
- Recommended ontologies (if any)
- How tools should interpret the data

### Current Extensions Under Development

| Extension | Covers | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| SONIC ARTS | Aesthetic, sound, production | Music, film, games |
| NARRATIVE CREATIVE | Themes, story, perspective | Songs, films, novels, games |
| LYRICAL CRAFT | Word choice, imagery, constraints | Songs, poetry, writing |
| VISUAL STORYTELLING | Visual style, cinematography | Films, games, marketing |
| STRATEGIC PLANNING | Goals, constraints, assumptions | Products, research, business |
| SYSTEM DESIGN | Architecture, requirements | Software, engineering |

---

## Project Types vs Extensions

These two metadata fields serve different purposes and are independent of each other.

**Type** = what kind of project this IS.
- Community-defined (each domain defines their own)
- Examples: `song`, `album`, `film`, `feature`, `design`
- Helps tools understand the project's role in a hierarchy

**Extensions** = conceptual frameworks this project USES.
- Cross-cutting (same extension used by multiple types)
- Examples: SONIC ARTS, NARRATIVE CREATIVE
- Optional: use what fits

**Examples of flexibility:**

| Project | Type | Extensions |
|---|---|---|
| Instrumental song | `song` | SONIC ARTS |
| Narrative song | `song` | SONIC ARTS + NARRATIVE CREATIVE |
| Documentary film | `film` | VISUAL STORYTELLING |
| Narrative film | `film` | VISUAL STORYTELLING + NARRATIVE CREATIVE |
| Technical product | `product` | STRATEGIC PLANNING + SYSTEM DESIGN |
| Creative product | `product` | STRATEGIC PLANNING + NARRATIVE CREATIVE |

**Analogy:** Type is your profession (engineer, filmmaker). Extensions are skill sets you use (data analysis, visual design, storytelling). Same skills, different professions.

## Best Practices

### File Size and Scope

**Keep BRIEF.md focused on context, not content:**
- Typical size: 100–500 lines
- If exceeding 1,000 lines, consider splitting
- Don't paste entire scripts, specifications, or code
- Link to detailed documents rather than embedding

**What belongs in BRIEF.md:** Project identity and purpose, key decisions with rationale, constraints and boundaries, references and influences.

**What doesn't belong:** Full scripts or specifications, detailed implementation code, extensive research notes, task lists or timelines, marketing copy.

### When to Split

Consider multiple BRIEF.md files when:
- Project has clear subcomponents
- Different teams work on different parts
- Sections exceed 500 lines
- Contexts are truly independent

```
film/BRIEF.md              # Overall film context
film/scenes/s01/BRIEF.md   # Scene-specific context
film/scenes/s02/BRIEF.md   # Scene-specific context
```

### Solo vs Team Use

The format is the same; the dynamics differ:

**Solo creators:** BRIEF.md is mainly communication with your future self. Focus on the sections most likely to fade: Key Decisions, What This Is NOT, and motivational context (Why This Exists). You'll remember *what* the project is; you won't remember *why* you made specific choices.

**Teams:** BRIEF.md is alignment infrastructure. Focus on Key Decisions (prevents re-litigating resolved debates), constraints (prevents conflicting changes), and Open Questions (makes uncertainty visible). New team members read BRIEF.md to understand "why we built it this way" without archaeological digging.

### Updating BRIEF.md

**When to update:**
- When making significant decisions
- When constraints change
- When resolving open questions
- When project direction shifts

**How to update:**

For decisions with alternatives, document in Key Decisions first, then update affected sections. This creates a clear cause-and-effect relationship:

```markdown
# Key Decisions

### WHAT: Expanded scope to include acceptance theme
**WHY:** Bridge felt incomplete without emotional resolution
**WHEN:** 2026-02-03
**ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:**
- Keep pure restlessness → rejected: too one-dimensional
- Add anger/frustration → rejected: wrong emotional tone

# What This Is
A song about small-town restlessness and the quiet acceptance that follows.

**Updated:** 2026-02-03
```

For evolutionary understanding (no alternatives existed), update sections directly.

For resolved Open Questions, move them to Key Decisions with rationale.

**When to use Open Questions vs Key Decisions directly:**

If a question needs time to resolve (days or weeks of deliberation), log it as an Open Question first. If it's resolved immediately in the same work session, skip directly to Key Decisions.

### Version Control

- Commit BRIEF.md alongside related project changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Git provides complete change history: no need for separate versioning in the file
- Treat BRIEF.md changes as significant events

### Multi-Author Projects

- Establish ownership/approval process for BRIEF.md changes
- Review BRIEF.md updates as a team
- Resolve conflicts in Open Questions before moving to Key Decisions

### Privacy and Sensitivity

Before sharing BRIEF.md externally:
- Review for confidential information
- Consider if decisions reveal unreleased plans
- Remove sensitive business details
- Remember BRIEF.md files may be indexed or cached

---

## Security Considerations

BRIEF.md files may contain sensitive information (unreleased project details, strategic decisions, proprietary technical choices). Security is an implementation concern, not a format specification.

**General guidance:** Apply security controls appropriate to the sensitivity of your content. This includes file system permissions, encryption, access control, and compliance requirements as appropriate for your organisation.

**Security postures range from:**
- **Open source projects:** Public repository, community access
- **Small teams:** Private repository, team-level access
- **Enterprise:** On-premise infrastructure, strict access controls, audit logging, compliance requirements

The specification intentionally does not mandate specific security measures, allowing organisations to apply appropriate controls based on their needs.

---

## Metadata Lifecycle and Public Exposure

BRIEF.md files are typically private during development. After release, certain metadata may become valuable for public discovery.

### What Might Be Public After Release

**Potentially shareable:** Themes, genres, moods, instrumentation, production techniques, architecture patterns, technology choices: metadata that helps discovery.

**Typically private:** Key Decisions (reveals strategic reasoning), Open Questions (shows internal process), "What This Is NOT" (may reveal competitive positioning).

These are considerations, not rules. Your context determines what to share.

### Tool Responsibilities for Export

Tools that export metadata to public platforms SHOULD:

1. **Allow user review**: show exactly what will be made public
2. **Require explicit approval** before export
3. **Provide selection interface**: allow users to include/exclude specific fields
4. **Provide sensible defaults**: typically excluding Key Decisions and Open Questions
5. **Map to platform formats**: convert BRIEF.md metadata to platform-specific taxonomies
6. **Respect user control**: support "keep everything private" as a valid choice

**Privacy principle:** Users retain full control over what becomes public. The default is private. Public exposure requires explicit user action.

---

## Versioning

### Specification Versioning

This specification uses semantic versioning:
- **Major:** Breaking changes to core structure
- **Minor:** Additive changes (new extensions, new fields)
- **Patch:** Clarifications and fixes

### File Versioning

Individual BRIEF.md files may include a `**Version:**` field indicating which spec version they follow. If omitted, tools assume latest v1.x.

---

## Building a BRIEF.md Integration

If you want to add BRIEF.md support to your tool, here's a minimal integration path:

### Level 1: Read and Display
- Parse metadata fields (lenient parsing)
- Display core sections to users
- No hierarchy walk needed

### Level 2: Hierarchy-Aware
- Walk up directory tree to discover parent BRIEF.md files
- Display accumulated context
- Respect the 10-level depth limit

### Level 3: Write Support
- Generate BRIEF.md skeleton on project creation
- Prompt users for context at natural decision points
- Preserve unknown sections and comments when editing

### Level 4: AI Integration
- Feed BRIEF.md content to AI tools at session start
- Propose BRIEF.md updates after working sessions
- Check AI output against documented constraints
